Santa's Toy Warfare is a Multiplayer Christmas FPS where you play with your friends in a snowball fight to get all the toys in the neighborhood!

Each match consists of a 2v2 snowball fight following the rules of a normal "Capture the flag" gamemode, where players must run to the enemy spawn point, capture the gift under the christmas tree, and take it to the team's christmas tree to secure a point! The first team in collecting 4 enemy gifts wins the game.
